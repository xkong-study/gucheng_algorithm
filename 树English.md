Here‚Äôs a comprehensive list of **phrases, words, and explanations** you may encounter in a coding interview, particularly when discussing **trees, recursion, DFS, backtracking, and dynamic programming**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ General Algorithm and Problem-Solving Terms**

- **Time complexity**: The amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size.
- **Space complexity**: The amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to input size.
- **Optimization**: Improving efficiency in terms of time and/or space.
- **Brute-force approach**: Trying all possible solutions to find the correct one.
- **Edge case**: A special input that may cause problems (e.g., empty input, maximum input).
- **Corner case**: An unusual case that is close to a limit or boundary.
- **Recurrence relation**: An equation that defines a sequence based on previous terms.
- **Trade-offs**: Balancing between different approaches (e.g., time vs. space).

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Recursion & DFS (Depth-First Search)**

- **Recursive function**: A function that calls itself with a smaller problem.
- **Base case**: The stopping condition for a recursive function.
- **Recursive stack**: The stack of function calls in recursion.
- **Stack overflow**: When too many recursive calls cause the stack to exceed memory limits.
- **Backtracking**: Exploring possible solutions and undoing choices if needed.
- **Memoization**: Caching previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Top-down approach**: Solving the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems recursively.
- **Bottom-up approach**: Solving subproblems first and building up to the final solution.

üîπ **Example phrases:**

- "This problem can be solved using recursion because the solution depends on smaller subproblems."
- "We need a base case to stop the recursion and prevent infinite loops."
- "We use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times."
- "The recursion depth is proportional to the height of the tree."

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees**

### **Tree Terminology**

- **Root node**: The topmost node in a tree.
- **Leaf node**: A node with no children.
- **Parent & Child**: A node directly above/below another node.
- **Sibling nodes**: Nodes that share the same parent.
- **Height of a tree**: The longest path from root to a leaf.
- **Depth of a node**: The distance from the root to that node.
- **Balanced tree**: A tree where the difference in height between left and right subtrees is at most 1.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree where left child < parent < right child.

üîπ **Example phrases:**

- "To find the maximum depth of a tree, we use a recursive DFS approach."
- "A balanced binary tree ensures that searching takes O(log N) time."
